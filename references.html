<h1>Eating Rules</h1>
<p><a href="https://eatingrules.com/" title="Eating Rules" target="_blank">Eating Rules</a>, created by Andrew Wilder, was used to help aid in describing the appearances, textures, sizes, and cooking times for the different types of oats. 
The guest post, <a href="https://eatingrules.com/types-of-oatmeal/" title="The Types of Oatmeal" target="_blank">The Types of Oatmeal</a> by vegetarian dietitian Kristine Duncan, highlighted the differences between the different types of oats regarding their appearances, textures, sizes, and cooking times. 
Kristine's post about "The Types of Oatmeal" also addressed misconception about processed foods, and the levels/types of processing that the oat selected goes through before being prepared by a hungry consumer.

<h1>Whole Grains Council</h1>
<p><a href="http://wholegraincouncil.org/" title="The Whole Grains Council">The Whole Grains Council</a> was used as a starting point for writing this website because it contains so much information on the health benefits of oats, the uses of oats, historical and cultural information around oats, 
how many of the oats available on the U.S. market are prepared/processed before being bought by consumers, fun facts about oats, and so much more. 
You can read more all about this information their webpage, <a href="https://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grains-101/easy-ways-enjoy-whole-grains/grain-month-calendar/oats-%E2%80%93-january-grain-month"
title="Oats - January Grain of the Month">Oats - January Grain of the Month</a>. </p>

<p>The Whole Grains Council's webpage, <a href="https://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grains-101/easy-ways-enjoy-whole-grains/grain-month-calendar/oats-%E2%80%93-january-grain-month/types"
title="The Types of Oats">The Types of Oats</a>, provided specific information about the different types of oats that exist. 
This information provided by the Whole Grain Council helped put together the Oatmeal project by pointing out what different types of oats exist and general information about each type of oat (uses, texture, etc.)

<h1>My Fearless Kitchen</h1>
<p>Created by veterinarian/blogger Marybeth Feutz, <a href="https://www.myfearlesskitchen.com/about/" title="My Fearless Kitche">My Fearless Kitchen</a> served as another excellent resource in the development of The Oatmeal Project.
<a href="https://www.myfearlesskitchen.com/" title="My Fearless Kitchen">My Fearless Kitchen</a> contains a lot of recipes, kitchen and food tips, grocery store shopping tips, information about farming and food, and most importantly,
information about the different types of oatmeal!

In the <a href="https://www.myfearlesskitchen.com/different-types-oatmeal/" title="Different Types of Oatmeal">Different Types of Oatmeal</a>, the differences in appearance and texture, types of recipes that each could be used for or with, cooking times and methods, 
cooking utensils, and uses were discussed in great detail. Other detailed information about oats were the ingredients to watch out for (i.e. perservatives, sugar, salts, etc.) with certain types of oats, where to find certain oats, and the level of
processing that different types of oats undergo. The article also provided close up images of the different types of oats so that viewers could see the differences between the oats' appearances in great detail.
