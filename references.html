<h1>Eating Rules</h1>
<p><a href="https://eatingrules.com/" title="Eating Rules" target="_blank">Eating Rules</a>, created by Andrew Wilder, was used to help aid in describing the appearances, textures, sizes, and cooking times for the different types of oats. 
The guest post, <a href="https://eatingrules.com/types-of-oatmeal/" title="The Types of Oatmeal" target="_blank">The Types of Oatmeal</a> by vegetarian dietitian Kristine Duncan, highlighted the differences between the different types of oats regarding their appearances, textures, sizes, and cooking times. 
Kristine's post about "The Types of Oatmeal" also addressed misconception about processed foods, and the levels/types of processing that the oat selected goes through before being prepared by a hungry consumer.
