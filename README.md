# Oatmeal
This is a project I created about the different types of oatmeal available for breakfast. I started this project in September of 2017 and was encouraged to post it here as I continue to explore web development. The project only uses HTML and CSS; I haven't learned Javascript yet because I am trying to get a better foundation with HTML and CSS before I start diving into more of what many people would describe as "real programming". 

After reviewing the project now from when I started to now, I see many changes and improvements that could be made to improve the functionality, layout, structure, and presentation of this project. However, this project will serve as a reminder to me of how far I have come in web development as I continue to practice and develop my skills.
