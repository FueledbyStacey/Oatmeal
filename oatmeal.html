     <!--Instant Oats Section -->   
      
    <section>
      <h2 id="instant">~ Instant Oats ~</h2>
	  <div id="oat-images">
	  <img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-instant-oat-or-oatmeal-in-wooden-spoon-204375994.jpg" title="Instant Oats"/>
	  </div>
	    <p>This oat option is usually found in branded boxes (most commonly by the <i>Quaker</i>, or the store's generic brand) that present you with a variety of different types of flavors. These types of oats have already been pre-cooked and placed in individual, pre-portioned, packets that let you know how much water to add, what one serving looks like realistically, and the nutritional value of one packet.</p>
            
        <h3>The Benefits of Picking Instant Oats</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the benefits of picking this type of oat are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They are very convenient, requiring very little prep time. All you have to do is add hot water and boom! Oatmeal is ready within a minute! This makes this oat option great for those who are short on time, and want their oatmeal to be ready <em>instantly</em>. </li> <br />
            <li>They come in flavored varieties. This can be a easy and convenient way for you to spare yourself the time and hassle of figuring out how to flavor your oatmeal. In this case, you don't have to worry about adding in extra ingredients and flavors to make your oatmeal as you would like it. It's already done for you.</li> <br />
            <li>There are extra vitamins and minerals added! You'll have no problem getting some of your Calcium and Vitamin D in for the morning because these little flavor packets have got your back. Most of these pre-packaged sleeves of oats contain these essential vitamins and minerals added in to ensure you are getting some of your reccommended daily requirements</li> <br />
            <li>They are great for those who want to know exactly what a serving size looks like, and the nutritional value they are getting from one serving. These little pre-portioned packets of oats come with the nutritional information for each packet on the box; elimatinating one of the common hassles of trying to be pro-active about your health-- figuring how exactly how much <em>one</em> serving measures out to and looks like, and how much nutritional value you are getting from that one serving.</li> <br />
            <li>The only kitchen tools required to enjoy instant oats are a bowl or container of some size, water from the kitchen sink or warmed water from the stove (using a kettle, small cooking pot to boil water, or a microwave to add water to the oats), and a spoon or fork. The awesome thing about this oat option is that you just can add water to the oats and wait for them to soak up the water (roughly in a minute) and they are ready! If you like, you can add dairy (optional- only if you choose to substitute it for the water ,or add it in after using water), or use a microwave to heat up the instant oats (if using water from the kitchen sink and wanting the oats to be warm). Whatever you decide, these oats will be ready withinno time. </li> <br />
        </ul>
        
       <h3>The Drawbacks of Picking Instant Oats</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the drawbacks of picking this type of oat are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Though they may come with extra convenience of being ready within a minute, extra minerals and vitamins added, and the option of having flavors to choose from, the flavored little instant oat packets also come loaded with extra salt and sugar which are already abundant in a wide array of foods many people consume. In addition, this oat option usually contains artificial colors and flavors. This makes them not so much a nutritional super star for those looking to for more healthy food options.</li> <br />
            <li>Speaking of the sugar and salt contained in that <em>one serving</em> of the flavored instant oat option, check and see how much <em>one serving</em> it looks likes. You see why some people have to have more than one packet to fill satisfied.</li> <br />
            <li>If you're looking to eat less processed foods in order to clean up your diet or make certain lifestyle changes, then keep in mind that these flavored varieties of instant oats are heavily processed. This is why these packets come with extra vitamins and minerals, extra salt and sugar, and cook up so easily; it takes some heavy processing to make them this way.</li> <br />
            <li>Much of the original nutritional value and fiber content has been stripped away to make this oat option easier to cook. In order to up the nutritional value of Instant Oats, other nutritional sources are used to add back and enhance the product to contain higher sources of vitamins and minerals (not otherwise found in other oat option). </li> <br />
            <li>Texture wise, they can be a bit mushy so if you don't like mushy oats then you'll have to cut back on the pre-specified amount of water or milk that you're supposed to add to them.</li>
        </ul>

    <!--Quick Oats Section-->
        
    <section>
        <h2 id="quick">~ Quick Oats ~</h2>
		<div id="oat-images">
		<img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-whole-grain-rolled-oats-with-wooden-spoon-and-homespun-napkin-macro-with-extremely-shallow-dof-45472804.jpg" title="Instant Oats"/>
		</div>
		<p>This oat option is usually found in a round, cardboard/plastic-like tub, and are located at the bottom of the grocery store shelf (at least, in all my experiences). These oats have been steamed and rolled out to give them more of a flattened out appearance, and they are also smaller than rolled (or also known as old-fashioned oats) because they have been chopped into smaller pieces. By doing these extra steps, these steps aid in decreasing the amount of time for cooking them and lends them the name "quick" oats.</p>
        
        <h3>The Benefits</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the benefits of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Similar to <a href="#instant">Instant Oats</a>, these oats cook very quickly (roughly in one to two minutes) due to them being already pre-steamed, rolled out, and cut up into smaller pieces.</li> <br />
            <li>There is no extra salt or sugar added to them. They're just plain old oats which makes them great for individuals who are watching, and or limiting their daily sugar and salt intake.</li> <br />
            <li>Similar as to what was mentioned in the bullet above about not having extra sugar or salt added, there are also no additional flavors or artificial colors added. This allows you to customize the flavor and whatever extras you would like to add to your oatmeal.</li> <br />
            <li>They are not automatically a "breakfast food". Given their lack of pre added sugar, salt, and flavors, this allows you to make them into a savory oatmeal or a sweet oatmeal. Whether you prefer your oatmeal to be one that is mixed with eggs and veggies to create a savory oatmeal, or with some sugar, peanut butter, chocolate, or fruit to create a sweet oatmeal, you have total control over how your oatmeal is prepared, flavored, and made into the type of oatmeal you prefer.</li> <br />
            <li>For those who want to know exactly what a serving size looks like and want to have a bit of control over making their oatmeal in their own preferable image, this oat option basically requires you to take a measuring cup and measure out how much a serving of quick oats equals out to be (don't worry, somewhere on the tub of quick oats there will be a conversion chart of the ratio of oats to water to help you out). This can be the perfect start in learning how to take figure out what a serving size is/looks like and what kind of nutritional values are in a serving for those who are curious about, or wanting to have control over, their serving sizes. </li> <br />
            <li>The only kitchen tools you'll need to cook this oat option is access to a microwave to heat up the oatmeal, water from the kitchen sink or warmed water from the stove (using small cooking pot to boil water that the oats will be cooked in), dairy (optional- only if you choose to substitute it for the water or add it in after using water), a bowl, a spoon or a fork, a measuring cup (to measure out a serving size and to get the right ratio of water to oats) and whatever extras you may want to add to the oatmeal (e.g. eggs, peanut butter, honey, chocolate, the list could go on and on). </li> <br />
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the drawbacks of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Unlike <a href="#instant" title= "Instant Oats">Instant Oats</a>, these oats come without the added "extras" (i.e. the flavors, colors, the sugar, salt, vitamins, minerals, and extras). This could be drawback for those who want pre-added extra vitamins and minerals to achieve daily nutritional requirements. If you're looking for extra vitamins and minerals to satisfy those daily requirements, you're going to have to add extra ingredients or find other ways and means to supplement those requirements.</li> <br />
        <li>Since this oat option comes as a plain Jane/John, you'll have to put in a bit more extra work to prepare this oat option. You will have to have the extra ingredients on hand to make these oats to your liking since they are sold without all the bells and whistles.</li> <br />
        <li>Since this oat option is still a bit processed due to make it easier to cook and have ready to eat within shorter amount of time, it may not leave you as satisfied (according to some sources). </li> <br />
        <li>This oat option also requires that you measure out a serving(s) of quick oats, and also measure out the proper ratio of the water portion to the oat portion of your serving(s). For those who may be uncomfortable measuring out serving sizes, or those who want the convenience of having their oats already pre-measured and pre-portioned for them, then this oat option may pose as a setback. </li> <br />
        <li>If you don't like mushy oatmeal then this oat option might not be for you. Oh poopie doop, I guess.</li> <br />
        </ul>

     <!--Old Fashioned/Rolled Oats-->    
    
    <section>
        <h2 id="old">~ Old Fashioned Oats ~</h2>
		<div id="oat-images">
		<img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-old-fashioned-rolled-oats-in-a-bowl-on-wooden-table-diet-and-breakfast-711262714.jpg" title="Old Fashioned Oats"/>
		</div>
		<p>Also known as Rolled Oats, this oat option is also usually found in a round, cardboard/plastic-like tub, and is usually located at the bottom of the grocery store shelf (once again, in my own experiences). 
			These oats (similar to <a href="#quick" title= "Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a>) have already been pre-steamed and rolled out into flat flakes to aid in their cooking process. Since they are not cut up into smaller pieces like <a href="#quick" title= "Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a> are, it takes them a bit longer to cook them.</p>
        
        <h3>The Benefits</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the benefits of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This oat option is not as processed as the <a href="#instant" title="Instant Oats">Instant Oats</a> and the <a href="#quick" title="Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a>. This means more of the original nutritional value and fiber content of the oat is retained.</li> <br />
            <li>Like <a href="#quick" title= "Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a>, this oat option doesn't come with all the "extras" (e.g. the sugar, salt, artificial flavors and colors, dried fruit, and pre-added vitamins and minerals) which allows you to customize it to you liking. This is great for individuals who are watching their salt and sugar intake, and also for those who are trying to be more health conscious. </li> <br />
            <li>this oat option is also a great way for those who want to have a more hands on approach in making their oatmeal and customizing it how they would prefer it to be, and those who want to figure out and practice with what a serving size looks like by measuring out the oat serving with a measuring cup (don't worry, a conversion table is usually found somewhere on the container).</li> <br />
            <li>Also like <a href="#quick" title= "Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a>, with Old-Fashioned oats you can make your oatmeal into a savory or sweet oatmeal since all of the pre-added "extras" are missing. Though this oat option may also be a plain Jane/John, the opportunities to create an oatmeal in your image are endless.</li> <br />
            <li>A cool thing about Old Fashioned Oats is that you can make Overnight Oats, which is exactly as it sounds. If you're usually running short on time in the mornings, you can prepare this oat option the night before by throwing everything into a jar or container. <strike>I would strongly reccommend throwing the fresh fruit in the morning of (if making a sweet oatmeal) unless you don't mind soggy or brown looking fruit</strike>. All you have to do is grab it up and go-- eating it cold and on the go, or heating it up (if you were prefer it warm) for a minute or so before heading out the door.</li> <br />
            <li>The only kitchen tools you'll need to cook this oat option is access to a microwave to heat up the oatmeal, water from the kitchen sink or warmed water from the stove (using small cooking pot to boil water that the oats will be cooked in), dairy (optional- only if you choose to substitute it for the water or add it in after using water), a bowl, a spoon or a fork, a measuring cup (to measure out a serving size and to get the right ratio of water to oats) and whatever extras you may want to add to the oatmeal (e.g. eggs, peanut butter, honey, chocolate, the list could go on and on).</li> <br />
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the drawbacks of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Just like <a href="#quick" title= "Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a>, this oat option comes without all the bells and whistles. Since there is no extra sugar, salt, flavors, vitamins, and minerals added, this oat option requires that you put in a bit of extra work by flavoring and tweaking flavor wise to fit your oatmeal preference. This means you'll have to have the "extras" (dairy, sugar, fruits, veggies, chocolate, honey, etc.) on hand if you want your oatmeal to be something other than plain and boring (no offense intented to those who like it plain!). </li> <br />
            <li>This option also will require you to measure out a serving of oats and figure out the ratio of water to oats, if you want to know how much one serving measures out to be and looks like size wise. This takes a little more time to do, and can be considered a drawback to those who want everything ready to go (by that I mean where you just add water/dairy, heat it up, and it's ready to go). </li> <br />
            <li>The most notable difference with Old Fashioned Oats is the cooking time. With <a href="#instant" title="Instant Oats">Instant Oats</a> and <a href="#quick" title="Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a> it only takes them roughly a one to two minutes to prepare, but with Old Fashioned Oats it takes anywhere from three-ish minutes in the microwave or five to ten minutes on the stove top. For those in a rush, cooking Old Fashioned Oats may not be the best of option for them to choose if mornings are usually rushed. <strike>Though, Overnight Oats can come to the rescue!</strike>. </li> <br />
            <li>The finished product (depending on the ratio of water to oats, or dairy to oats) is typically <i>creamy</i>; it is not mushy like <a href="#instant" title="Instant Oats">Instant Oats</a> and <a href="#quick" title="Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a> and tends to have more of texture to it.  </li> <br />
            <li>If you chose to cook this oat option in on the stove top then you'll have slightly longer clean up process than you would with the Instant oats. </li> <br />
        </ul>

     <!--Oat Groat Section-->

        <h2 id="groats">~ Oat Groats ~</h2>

		<img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-closeup-oats-heaped-in-a-glass-cup-on-wooden-table-99435569.jpg" title="Oat Groats"/>
		</div>
		   <p>This oat option is usually found in health stores, or in the speciality section of some store's breakfast isle. One of the most notable and easy to find brand that sells this oat option would be <a href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/shop/oats/whole-oat-groats.html" title="Bob's Red Mill Oat Groats">Bob's Red Mill</a>. An oat groat is basically the purest form of an oat grain, other than stripping the hull off the oat grain to make it edible (the hulls serve as protection to the oat grain, are extremely tough, and not meant to be eaten). This oat option takes the longest amount of time to cook when compared to other oat options. </p>
        
        <h3>The Benefits</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the benefits of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're looking for an oat option that is minimally processed and has none of the "extras" included, then Oat Groats are a great option for you. This oat option only has the hull removed from them, which means that all of the oat's bran and germ (which contains its nutritional value and its fiber content) is left intact. Since the bran and germ is left intake, this allows you to get more of the oat's original nutritional value. Also, since these oats are basically the original form that oats come in, there is no need to worry or stress out about how much extra sugar, salt, preservatives, colors, and flavors have already been added to the oats. This oat option literally the plainest Jane/John that you could get and is waiting for you to scuplt it into your own ideal oat image.</li> <br />
            <li>Like <a href="#quick" title="Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a> and <a href="#old" title="Old Fashioned Oats">Old Fashioned Oats</a>, this oat option is great for those who like to have control over what they want to put into their oatmeal, and for those who want to have a more involved part in making their oatmeal. This oat option will definitely have you getting involved in measuring out serving sizes, determining the ratio of water to oats, and allow for you to use more kitchen tools to create your oatmeal. To create this oatmeal, you're going to need to do one of the following: 
                <ol> <br />
                <li>Soak your oat groats overnight (highly, highly recommended from the sources I have found), and then cook it on the stove top in boiling water for basically an hour. </li> <br />
                <li>Or add your oat groats with the proper ratio of water to oats to a slow cooker, a rice cooker, or a dutch oven for an extended amount of time to let them cook properly.</li> <br />
                </ol> <br />
                
            <li>This oat option is great to make ahead of time on weekend or on a day that you're off so you can have oats ready to eat throughout the week. You can take these oats and make the traditional sweet breakfast oatmeal with your own extra ingredients, you can make a savory oatmeal to enjoy for breakfast (if you like more of a serious breakfast), or since this oat option has more of an rice-like texture then you can add it to salad dishes, make a pilaf with it, or use it in other cooking adventures and dishes. </li> <br />
            <li>If you happen to have a grain mill at home, you could also ground the groats into <a href="#steel" title="Steel Oats">Steel Oats</a>, or into an Oat Flour.</li> <br />
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the drawbacks of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The biggest drawback to picking this oat option is the amount of time that it takes to cook! If you're cooking Oat Groats on the stove top, you have to soak them overnight <em>and then</em> cook them for about an hour on top of the stove before they are ready. If you're cooking them in a rice cooker, a slow cooker, or a dutch oven, then you'll have to wait even longer before they are ready (we're talking about potentially up to <strong>eight</strong>).</li> <br />
            <li>If you're thinking that the amount of time required to cook Oat Groats was bad, then you'll definitely not like the extra prep work you'll have to do to flavor them to your liking after they are done cooking. Since they are definitely a plain Jane/John, you'll have to have the "extras" on hand if you're wanting to create your oatmeal to your own liking and preferences (nutritional and flavor wise).</li> <br />
            <li>You <strong>have</strong> to do more work on measuring out the right ratio of water to oats with Oat Groats. Yes, you can make this oat option a bit more creamier if you add a bit more water, but if you don't add enough water then you'll end up with <i>crunchy</i> oats (this could be disaster to those do not like their oatmeal to be crunchy). With this option, you will definitely <strong>need</strong> measuring and kitchen tools, and the right equipment to work with this oat option.</li> <br />
            <li>Using the microwave is <strong>not</strong> an option, and strongly not recommended to cook and prepare these oats in. So if you're in a crunch for time, the microwave cannot, and will <b>not</b> be able to, do all cook preparation work for you.  </li> <br />
            <li>The clean up process is definitely more involved than simply washing a bowl and utensils, as you would only have to do with <a href="#instant" title="Instant Oats">Instant</a>, Quick, and Old-Fashioned Oats (given that you chose to use the beautiful invention called <i>a microwave</i> to cook those oat options in). </li>
        </ul>

     <!--Steel-Cut Oats Section-->

		<img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-raw-organic-steel-cut-oats-in-a-bowl-267494765.jpg" title="Steel Cut Oats"/>
		</div>
            <p>If you had a chance to check out the section on <a href="#groats" title="Oat Groats">Oat Groat</a>, then Steel-Cut oats are basically Oat Groats that have been cut up into smaller pieces. However, unlike <a href="#intant" title="Instant Oats">Instant Oats</a>, <a href="#quick" title="Quick Oats">Quick Oats</a>, and <a href="#old" title="Old-Fashioned Oats">Old-Fashioned Oats</a>,this oat option has not been rolled out, steamed, or pressed into a flatter like flake. Steel-Cut oats are recognized by their other name, Irish Oats. Steel-Oats have a chewy, creamy, thick-like texture when cooked. The taste of these oats (when tasted plain) has a slight nutty flavor, more so than the plain Quick and Old-Fashioned Oats. </p>
            
        <h3>The Benefits</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the benefits of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This oat option is minimally processed and comes without all the "extras" (i.e. sugar, artificial flavors and colors, salt, etc.). The only thing that could be considered an "extra" about this oat option is the slight chopping process that it has underwent before you get to touch it. This oat option also makes a great option for those who want to customize their oats to fit their nutritional and flavor preferences, and for those who happen to have the extra ingredients on hand to create this oat option in their own image (savory, sweet, you name it). In addition, for those who want to practice interacting with and gaining experience with what a serving size looks like, this option will allow for them to actively get involved with measuring serving sizes. </li> <br />
            <li>The wonderful thing about this oat option is that it takes a lot less time to cook than Oat Grouts on the <u>stove top</u>. Steel-Cut Oats do not require soaking overnight, <i>and</i> the cooking time for them is only between twenty to thirty minutes. However, if you're into a measure-dump-set-leave-then enjoy method (i.e. measuring out the serving size(s) and right ratio of water to oats, dumping it all into slow cooker, rice cooker, or instant pot, and leaving it to do all the work while you do whatever you want or need to do), then this oat option is perfect for those who want to be able to set a timer and check back in later when the food is ready! </li> <br />
            <li>Just like Oat Groats, Steel-Cut Oats also have the bran and germ left intact (allowing for its original nutritional value and higher fiber content to be retained). </li> <br />
            <li>Another great option for those who are into Meal Prep days! Also, no worries about figuring out that ratio of water to oats if you want to make either an individual, small, or larger batch of Steel-Cut Oats in advance or right then. A conversion chart with the ratio of oats to water will be listed somewhere on the Steel-Oat's package or container. </li> <br />
            <li>The only kitchen tools and equipment needed to enjoy Steel-Cut oats are a stove top burner, a cooking pot, measuring tools, the oats themselves, access to water (tap water or bottled water), a spoon and or a fork, a bowl, a microwave (if reheating the finished product), and time. 
                <ul> <br />
                    <li>Note that if you are wanting to employ the measure-dump-set-leave-then enjoy method, you will need to have one of the following: a rice cooker, a slow cooker/Crockpot, or an instant pot.</li> <br />
                </ul>
            
            </li> <br />
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the drawbacks of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As mentioned in the <i>Drawback</i> sections of Quick oats, Old-Fashioned oats, and Oat Groats, Steel-Cut oats are a plain Jane/John. Unless you enjoy your oatmeal plain (not knocking anyone who does). then this oat option will require that you add and have on hand your own "extras" to make this oat option fit your nutritional and flavor preferences, and also take a more involved stance with the oats (i.e. measuring out the proper ratio of oat and having the necessary kitchen equipment/tools). </li> <br />
            <li>Though the cooking time may be shorter than the time required to cook Oat Groats, twenty to thirty minutes is still a long time to have to wait on this oat option to cook. This can be deal breaker to those who do not have twenty to thirty minutes to wait for their oats to cook, then spend up to an additional five to ten minutes preparing the "extras" to add to their oatmeal. </li> <br />
            <li>The microwave cannot be used to cook this oat option, unless you are just heating it back up after you cooked it on the stove top. For those who do not have access to a stove top or a single burner (i.e. college students or those who do not have the luxury of having a stove top), then this makes this oat option unappealing. </li> <br />
            <li>The clean up process is a tad bit more involved than it would be with Instant, Quick, and Old-Fashioned Oats. This is due to the Steel-Cut oats requirement that they be cooked on the stove top (or a slow cooker, rice cooker, or instant pot if you're feeling up to using them to cook your oats and then clean them afterwards). </li> <br />
            <li>Making overnight oats is not really suggested with this oat option because the oats really need to be cooked in order for them to be edible. </li> <br />
        </ul>

        <p>Whereas <a href="#steel" title="Steel-Cut Oats">Steel-Cut Oats</a> were basically <a href="#groats" title="Oat Groats">Oat Groats</a> that had been chopped up into slightly smaller pieces (e.g. like a rice grain chopped into two or three smaller pieces, or an appearance similar to those of rock bits/pieces), Scottish Oats are basically Oat Groats that have been <i>ground</i> down into a course-like, finer-like (i.e. almost like flour, but more course) oat flake. Scottish Oats are considered to be a sub-type of Steel-Cut Oats Groats, differing only because they are ground into a course-like flour flake. This grounding procedure makes them take on a more of creamy and thicker texture when cooked, and allows them to be a much quicker cooking oat option.</p>
            
        <h3>The Benefits</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the benefits of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This oat option only takes about ten minutes to cook on the stove top or a three to five minute cooking time if using the microwave. This makes this oat option great for those who still want an oat option that is less processed <em>and</em> offers the option of a shorter and more convenient cooking time. In addition, if one does want the option of employing a measure-dump-set-leave-then enjoy method (i.e. measuring out the serving size(s) and right ratio of water to oats, dumping it all into slow cooker/Crockpot/rice cooker/instant pot, and then leaving it to do all the work while you do whatever you want or need to do), then this oat option only takes <b>two</b> hours to cook on <b>low</b>. </li> <br />
            <li>If you like warm, soft, and creamy oatmeal then this oat option is definitely a great option for you. It is a perfect start for those bitter cold winter mornings. </li> <br />
            <li>Like with <a href="#quick" title="Quick Oats">Quick</a>, <a href="#old" title="Old Fashioned Oats">Old-Fashioned</a>, Oat Groats, and Steel-Cut Oats, this oat option also can be customized to fit your nutritional preferences and needs. Also, as long as you have the "extras" on hand then you can easily customize the flavor of your oatmeal by adding the ingredients that will allow it to turn into more of a savory, or sweet oatmeal.  </li> <br />
            <li>This oat option is also great for those wanting to get more experience with learning how and what a serving size actually looks like, wanting to learn how to take control of their health by monitoring what and how much goes into their food, determining how to measure and determine a serving size for themselves, and for those wanting to get more practice in taking a more involved stance in actively learning how make healthier meals for themselves (and hopefully influence other individuals to adopt such practices as well). </li> <br />
            <li>The amount of clean up time for this oat option is very appealing, considering the options you have available to you in what kitchen tools you decide you use to make the oatmeal. </li> <br />
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the drawbacks of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One notable drawback to this oat option would be that you have to have the "extra" ingredients (i.e. salt, sweetener, dairy, nut butter, chocolate, fruit, etc) available, or have the ability (and funds) to go out and buy them. Having the "extras" is a requirement in order to customize your oatmeal to fit your flavor preferences.  </li> <br />
            <li>In addition, you also need to have the necessary kitchen and cooking equipment (i.e. a stove top or single burner, a microwave, measuring cup/tools, a bowl, and a spoon or fork) on hand to create and enjoy this oat option.</li> <br />
            <li>If you're not into having to measure out the right proportion of water to oats, are uncertain and confused on how much of the "extras" to add to follow a certain oatmeal recipe, or just don't like the requirement of having to take a more involved stance in personally customizing your oats, then this oat option may not be for you. </li> <br />
            <li>Since this oat option also comes as a plain Jane/John, it does not come with additional nutritional value added to it. If you're looking to add more minerals and vitamins by just eating oatmeal, then you may need to look at other oat options that already come with extra nutritional values added (e.g. <a href="#instant" title="Instant Oats">Instant Oats</a>). In order to get such extra nutritional values, you'll have to manually add the "extra" foods that have these nutritional values in them. If you're not wanting to add the "extras" to your oatmeal (making it plain Jane/John) but still prefer this oat option, then you'll need to supplement those nutritional requirements by taking a daily multi-vitamin; through specific types of vitamins offer on the marketplace; or by eating other types of foods at other meal times that contain such nutritional values. </li> <br />
            <li>If you choose to make this oat option on the stove top or on a single burner, then the clean up process will be a bit longer than had you chosen to use the microwave. </li> <br />
        </ul>

		</div>
            <p>The first time I found out that this oat option existed was when I was making this guide for you! So what exactly is Oat Bran? According to blogger Beth Moncel, who runs the frugal and niffy <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/07/beginners-guide-oats/" title="Budget Bytes" target="_blank">Budget Byte$</a>, Oat Bran is literally the outer, fiberous part of the <a href="#groat" title="Oat Groat">Oat Groat</a>. This oat option comes into existence when the outer part of the Oat Groat has been removed and milled into fine, powder-like, oat flake. When cooked with hot water, Oat Bran's texture is similar to that of <i>Cream of Wheat</i>. </p>
        
        <h3>The Benefits</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the benefits of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This oat option is extremely easy to make. Whether you are making on the stove top or in the microwave, the amount of time required to cook this oat option is only between two to three minutes. If you're into using a slow cooker like appliance to create oatmeal, then this oat option will only take <u>one</u> hour to cook on <b>low</b>. These cooking options make this perfect for those who only have access to one of the three cooking appliances mentioned. </li> <br />
            <li>If you are looking to increase your fiber intake, then this oat option may be a winner for you. One serving of this oat option (one-third of a cup) contains up to <u>seven</u> grams of fiber. To put this amount of fiber into perspective, the daily recommended intake of fiber is between twenty-five to thirty grams. Winner, winner!</li> <br />
            <li>This oat option is also great for those who are wanting to practice measuring serving sizes and create healthier meals for themselves. In order to determine how much one serving of Oat Bran equates out to, you'll need a handy dandy measuring cup or tool.</li> <br />
            <li>Oat Bran can be easily customized to take on more of a sweet or savory taste. All you have to do is add in the "extras" (e.g. peanut butter, sugar, eggs, spinach, etc) and wah-la! Your ideal oatmeal has been born! Adding these "extras" also makes this oat option perfect for those who are wanting to add certain or specific nutritional values into their daily diets without the extra sugar, salt, artificial flavors, or preservatives that are found in another quick and easy to make oat option known as <a href="#instant" title="Instant Oats">Instant Oats</a>.</li> <br />
            <li>The clean up process with this oat option is extremely simple. All you'll really need to clean is your bowl and eating utensils, your stovetop pot (if even used), and clean up your slow cooker like appliance (if even used).</li> <br />
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
        <p class="picking">Some of the drawbacks of picking this oat option are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This oat option is a plain Jane/John that will require you to have the "extras" on hand if you want to this oat option to have either a sweet or savory taste. The customization process will also add on extra time to the overall cooking time, so time crunchers beware. </li> <br />
            <li>If you're limiting your daily fiber intake due to medical reasons, then you will want to avoid this oat option because it is extremely high in fiber for the small amount that one serving size equals out to be. </li> <br />
            <li>You'll definitely need a measuring cup or tool on hand in order to determine what one serving size equals out to be and look like with this oat option. This makes this oat option a drawback for those who do not have the time to, do not really want to, or do not have the luxury of owning/having on hand a measuring tool/cup to measure out a serving size. Not having a measuring cup/tool will also prevent you from being able to determine the proper ratio of oats to water you'll need to know in order to create your oatmeal. </li> <br />
            <li>If you're looking for an oatmeal that comes with a nice dose of pre-added vitamins and minerals, then this oat option is not for you. You'll have to manaully add in the "extras" to make this oat option contain the nutritional values you are looking to obtain and increase in your diet.</li> <br />
            <li>If you know what the texture of <i>Cream of Wheat</i> tastes like and you do not like it, then this oat option is not for you!</li> <br />
